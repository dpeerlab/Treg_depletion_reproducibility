This folder contains example code to recreate some of the plots from the paper.

KP_model_data_filtering.html - This contains code to do the initial global and some lineage specific (Endothelial, Myeloid, Fibroblast) filtering. Since this file was more than 25 MB, we decided to break it into two files:

A) KP_model_data_filtering_part1.html
B) KP_model_data_filtering_part2.html
C) KP_model_data_filtering_part3.html


KP_model_endothelial_analysis.html - This contains code to analyze endothelial lineage (factor analysis, robustness of factors and Milo analysis) in the KP mouse model.

endo_exp2.py - Code to run scHPF factor analysis. Example provided for endothelial cells in the KP mouse model.
